In this Simulation, we focused several steps to generate a band diagram:

1. VC-Relax.in (input file)
2. scf.in (input file)
3. Bands.in (input file)
4. bands.pp.in (input file)
5. plotband.in (input file)

Correspnding the input files, the output files are generated as well.

After the simulation in vc-relax stage, we get the revised atomic positions, which is later used for scf simulation, thus finding the exact band diagram under
different temperature, lattice configurations.
